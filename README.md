This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Setup

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- Framer Motion
- Tailwind CSS
- Custom Hooks
- Deployed on Vercel

ðŸ§± Component Architecture
The project follows a modular component structure for reusability and maintainability.

HeroSection: Heading + Video + Scroll Line

ScrollProgressLine: Animated scroll indicator using framer-motion

FadeInVideo, FadeInVideo2: Reusable components with useInView

Navbar, Footer, etc.

ðŸ“Œ Why modular?
This allows easy scaling, testing, and debugging of individual components.

ðŸŽ¨ Design Adherence
Fully matches the provided Figma with pixel-perfect spacing, colors, and typography.

Used Tailwind for consistent design tokens.


âœ… Tested on:

Desktop (1024px and 1440px)

ðŸ“Œ Used flex, grid, and vh/vw units to ensure fluid layouts.

âš¡ Performance Optimization

âœ… Optimized image formats (SVG)

âœ… Code-splitting via Vite

âœ… Minimal bundle size (checked via Lighthouse)

â™¿ Accessibility Considerations
Used semantic HTML (<section>, <h1>, <video>, etc.)

Added alt, aria-labels, and keyboard-navigable elements

Follows WCAG 2.1 guidelines

Motion is respectful and not overwhelming

âœ¨ Animations
Used Framer Motion for scroll progress lines and fade-in effects

Thoughtfully placed to enhance UX without distraction

Smooth, performant, and optimized for low-power devices

ðŸ§ª Testing
Not implemented due to time constraints. However, Jest and React Testing Library would be used for unit testing in a future iteration.

ðŸ“˜ Third-Party Libraries
Library	Purpose
Framer Motion	Animations & scroll effects
React-Intersection-Observer	Triggering fade-ins on scroll
Tailwind CSS	Utility-first styling

ðŸ§  Assumptions & Decisions
Scroll line visually maps to combined HeroSection + HeroSecond

Videos autoplay on view with muted audio

One section = one concept/brand impression

All assets used were assumed to be hosted locally

ðŸš§ Challenges Faced :-
âš  SVG not loading on deployment â†’ fixed with public/ folder

âš  Scroll progress overlapping absolute elements â†’ fixed with layout restructure

ðŸ’¡ Animation jitter â†’ solved by limiting useInView to 0.2 threshold

ðŸ”® Future Improvements :- 
Add unit & integration tests

Improved accessibility for screen readers

Better state management if app scales
